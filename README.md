# NancyExample

This project is part of a blog post I wrote, you can read it [here](http://blog.bluehathacking.com/blog/2014/09/04/linking-a-cordova-android-application-to-a-database/).

This is a Nancyfx web site that will retrieve data from a submitted form and output results from a dataase in JSON format (that can subsequently be displayed in a Cordova Android app).


__Please note, this project was made with Nancy version 21.1.0. The current Nancy version available is 23+. Therefore, if you add an extension to Nancy (eg. authentication) you will need to remove Nancy entirely from the project and add it again (otherwise Visual Studio gets confused with reference versioning).__
